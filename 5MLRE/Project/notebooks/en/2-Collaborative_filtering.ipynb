    "The goal of Co-clustering is to find a way to group similar rows and columns of a matrix, like patterns, to make them more apparent. This method is useful when working on datasets with complex row and column relationships. The algorithm will first find a correlation between the rows and columns of the dataset. It will then use the k-mean method to group the data before interpreting the results."

    "\n",
    "<u>Machine Learning metrics:</u>\n",
    "- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): measure of the average deviation of the predicted values of the model. The lower, the better.\n",
    "- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): refers to the magnitude of difference between the prediction of an observation and the true value of that observation.\n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Recommendation systems metrics:</u>\n",
    "- Hit rate: the proportion of recommended items that are relevant to the user, expressed in percent.\n",
    "- Hit rate per rating value: is the hit rate but calculated independently for each of the possible ratings (from one to ten in our case).\n",
    "- Cumulative hit rate: is also the hit rate calculated for all rating values up to a certain threshold.\n",
    "- Average reciprocal hit rank (ARHR): is the average of the reciprocal ranks of the relevant items in the recommended list.\n",
    "- User coverage: is the proportion of users for whom the system is able to make recommendations.\n",
    "- Diversity: is the variety or dissimilarity of items recommended to users.\n",
    "- Novelty: is the degree to which recommended items are new or unexpected to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now compare our models. We are going to observe which is the best model for each metrics, and then conclude on the overall best model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model with the most interesting metric values is the KNN Baseline due to its good performance on RMSE, MAE and hit rate. It has a reasonable training time of seven seconds. Even though the grid search takes three hours, we already have the best parameters for this model, so we don't need to run the grid search again. In another hand, KNN With Means show us an interesting performance for ARHR and a training of three seconds. KNN Basic is automatically excluded because 35% of its predictions were impossible (one of the parameters was unknown to it).\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, based on the metrics and results we have at this moment of the training, KNN Baseline appears to be the most efficient model."
