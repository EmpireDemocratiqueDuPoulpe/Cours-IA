    "In the previous notebook, we loaded, cleaned and studied the [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) datasets. Now that we know them better, we will start to create the recommendation system using collaborative filtering. Collaborative filtering is a technique that filters out items that a user might like based on feedback from similar users. There are two sub-techniques: User-based collaborative filtering and article-based collaborative filtering.\n",
