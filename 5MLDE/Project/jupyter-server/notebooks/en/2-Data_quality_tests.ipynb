A new notebook named `datasource_new` is then created in the `jupyter-server/config/great_expectations/uncommitted` folder. Open this notebook and change the value `my_datasource` to whatever you want your datasource to be called. In this project, we named it \"android_malware\". Then, execute all cells in the notebook. If there is no problem, the last cell will print the newly created datasource."
